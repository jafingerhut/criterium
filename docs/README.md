# Introduction

The file `criterium-call-graph.dot` contains a partial call graph of
functions defined in the `criterium.core` namespace as of criterium
version 0.4.5.  The focus is on functions in the inner loops of
measuring the user's expression, but many more of the functions are
included, too.
